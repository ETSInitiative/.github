# PET Raw Data Standardisation Initiative (PRDSI)

This GitHub organisation hosts an informal collaboration between academics and industrial representatives for establishing a standard for the "raw" data for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners. We intend to cover acquired data (i.e. listmode and projection data) as well as calibration data (e.g. normalisation files, calibration factors, gantry alignment, ...)
