# Emission Tomography Standardisation Initiative (ETSI)

This GitHub organisation hosts an informal collaboration between academics and industrial representatives for establishing a standard for the "raw" data for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners, with later expanding to Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) and other emission modalities. We intend to cover acquired data (i.e. listmode and projection data) as well as calibration data (e.g. normalisation files, calibration factors, gantry alignment, ...).

More information on the initiative can be found at our website https://etsinitiative.org/.
